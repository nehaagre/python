    "4. Write a program that prompts the user to input a year and determine whether the year is a leap year or not.\n",
    "Leap Years are any year that can be evenly divided by 4. A year that is evenly divisible by 100 is a leap year only if it is also evenly divisible by 400. Example :\n",

    "6. The roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, a â‰  0 are given by the following formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, the term b2 - 4ac is called the discriminant. If b2 - 4ac = 0, then the equation has two equal roots.\n",
    "If b2 - 4ac > 0, the equation has two real roots. If b2 - 4ac < 0, the equation has two complex roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that prompts the user to input the value of a (the coefficient of x2), b (the coefficient of x), and c (the constant term) and outputs the roots of the quadratic equation. Solution\n",

    "60-69\tD\n",
    "0-59\tF Solution\n",
    "8. Write a program that prompts the user to input a number. Program should display the corresponding days to the number. For example if user type 1 the output should be sunday. If user type 7 the output should be saturday. \n",
